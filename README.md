## Git Basics 
[How to use Git and GitHub](./Git_and_GitHub/How_to_Use_Git_andGitHub.png) | [Git Branching-1](Git_and_GitHub/Learn_Git_Branching-1.png) | [Git Branching-2](Git_and_GitHub/Learn_Git_Branching-2.png) | [Git Branching-3](Git_and_GitHub/Learn_Git_Branching-1.png)  
**What was new:**  
Although I have been working with Git for some time, I have learnt more about the right strategies for merge conflict resolution.  
**What surprised:**  
It was good to know how version control system was implemented on other software(Dropbox, Google Docs, Wikipedia).  
**What will use:**  
I want to study out merging and working with remote repositories and also I want to customize command line using bash script for my convinience.  
## Linux CLI, and HTTP  
[Learn the Command Line](./task_linux_cli/Command_Line_Tutorial_Learn_The_Command_Line_Codecademy.png)  
**What was new:**  
I wasn't familiar with OPTIONS, TRACE, HEAD methods before. What's more I've learnt a bit about authentication types.  
**What surprised:**  
Closing keywords in conditionals and loops in bash(like fi, done) were weird for me.  
**What will use:**  
I plan to continue a project, where Express is used, so learning how HTTP response/request works is important.  
## Git Collaboration  
[What is Version Control](./task_git_collaboration/GitHub_Collaboration _Udacity.png) | [GitHub & Collaboration](./task_git_collaboration/Version_Control_with_Git _Udacity.png)  
**What was new:**  
I've finally understood the difference between revert and reset.  
**What surprised:**  
Commands git show <commit> and git log <commit> have different output.  
**What will use:**  
I encountered a lot of situations, where I had to restore the work from previous commits. Now I know how to revert changes without losing commits thanks to backup branches.
