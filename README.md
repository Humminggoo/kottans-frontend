[How to use Git and GitHub](./Git_and_GitHub/How_to_Use_Git_andGitHub.png) | [Git Branching-1](Git_and_GitHub/Learn_Git_Branching-1.png) | [Git Branching-2](Git_and_GitHub/Learn_Git_Branching-2.png) | [Git Branching-3](Git_and_GitHub/Learn_Git_Branching-1.png)  
**What was new:**  
Although I have been working with Git for some time, I have learnt more about the right strategies for merge conflict resolution.  
**What surprised:**  
It was good to know how version control system was implemented on other software(Dropbox, Google Docs, Wikipedia).  
**What will use:**  
I want to study out merging and working with remote repositories and also I want to customize command line using bash script for my convinience.  
## Linux CLI, and HTTP  
[Learn the Command Line](./task_linux_cli/Command_Line_Tutorial_Learn_The_Command_Line_Codecademy.png)  
**What was new:**  
I wasn't familiar with OPTIONS, TRACE, HEAD methods before. What's more I've learnt a bit about authentication types.  
**What surprised:**  
Closing keywords in conditionals and loops in bash(like fi, done) were weird for me.  
**What will use:**  
I plan to continue a project, where Express is used, so learning how HTTP response/request works is important.  
## Git Collaboration  
[What is Version Control](./task_git_collaboration/GitHub_Collaboration_Udacity.png) | [GitHub & Collaboration](./task_git_collaboration/Version_Control_with_Git_Udacity.png)  
**What was new:**  
I've finally understood the difference between revert and reset.  
**What surprised:**  
Commands git show <commit> and git log <commit> have different output.  
**What will use:**  
I encountered a lot of situations, where I had to restore the work from previous commits. Now I know how to revert changes without losing commits thanks to backup branches.

**What was new:**  
I got to know new atributes for tags(size for select and rows/cols for 
textarea).  
**What surprised:**  
There are 3 different tags for quotes - quote, q, cite.  
**What will use:**  
I've already used almost all tags, mentioned in these courses, but it 
helped to refresh my memory.  
## Responsive Web Design  
[Responsive Web Design

| [Flexbox 
Froggy](./task_responsive_web_design/Flexbox_Froggy.png)  
**What was new:**  
I've learnt about Device Independant Pixels and how they differ from 
Hardware Pixels.  
**What surprised:**  
Optimal size for buttons on mobile versions must be 40-48px.  
**What will use:**  
I will try link tags with media atribute, flexbox and grid for 
responsiveness.  
## JS Basics  
 [Intro to JavaScript](./task_js_basics/Intro_to_JavaScript_Udacity.png) 
| [Algorithms](./task_js_basics/algorithms1.png)  
**What was new:**  
I learnt new ways how iterate objects, used Array functions like filter, 
forEach, got to know how to create letters from charcode.  
**What surprised:**  
Incluses method makes a search in array simpler.  
**What will use:**  
I tend to complete more coding challenges on freecodecamp, i will think 
more about efficient and faster solutions for the problems.  
## DOM  
 [JavaScript and DOM](./task_js_dom/JavaScript_and_the_DOM.png) | 
[Algorithms](./task_js_dom/Algorithms2.png)  
**What was new:**  
I got acquainted with textContent property, learn that DOMContentLoaded 
more efficient than load event, better to use forEach array method than 
for loop and put event listeners on parent element rather than many 
child elements.  
**What surprised:**
Mousemove/mouseover and mouseleave/mouseenter events are kinda 
different(the latter don't bubble).  
**What will use:**  
If i want to add set of elements on page, I will use documentFragment as 
a wrapper, for individual elements - appendChild or 
insertAdjacentElement.
