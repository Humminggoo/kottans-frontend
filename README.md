**What was new:**  
Although I have been working with Git for some time, I have learnt more about the right strategies for merge conflict resolution.  
**What surprised:**  
It was good to know how version control system was implemented on other software(Dropbox, Google Docs, Wikipedia).  
**What will use:**  
I want to study out merging and working with remote repositories and also I want to customize command line using bash script for my convinience.
